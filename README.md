Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm or yarn

Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-chat-app.git
cd your-chat-app

Install Frontend Dependencies:

cd frontend # or client, or whatever your frontend directory is named
npm install
# or
yarn install

Install Backend Dependencies:

cd ../backend # or server, or api, or whatever your backend directory is named
npm install
# or

Set up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in your backend directory (and frontend if needed) and add your API keys and configuration details.

Example .env for backend:

PORT=5000
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
# ... other Firebase config details

Example .env for frontend (if using React with create-react-app or Vite):

# ... other Firebase config details

Replace placeholders with your actual Firebase project configuration.

Run the application:

Start the Backend Server:

cd backend
npm start # or node server.js, or whatever your start command is

cd frontend
npm start # or yarn start, or npm run dev

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (frontend) and http://localhost:5000 (backend API).
